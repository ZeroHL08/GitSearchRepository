Programming Assignment: Autocomplete Page

 

Implement an autocomplete service based on the github Search API (https://developer.github.com/v3/search/),

 

The service needs to have the following:

* A webpage that allows the user to enter a search term into a text input and the form will perform an AJAX call to a REST API.

* A REST API that is called by the form stated above. This REST API then performs a backend (Server side) call to Github Search API.

 

It can be described that the form proxy the call via the backend REST API.

 

In the submission, please provide the code (preferably in a github repo), with instructions on how to setup and run the service on a local environment.

 

Please use any programming language you are most comfortable with.

 

This exercise should take between 2 to 8 hours of effort. For the autocomplete interactions, please make the necessary assumptions for UX and proceed.
